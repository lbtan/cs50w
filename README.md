Projects I did for Harvard's cs50w online course on web programming (https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)

1. Search: Used HTML and CSS to design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

2. Wiki: Used Python's Django framework to design a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia.
